PROMPT_generation = '''
You are an information generation expert. 

Based on your judgment, you need to categorize the results into the following four types and provide reasons:
The user will give you a text (and possibly a picture) and a requirement. You need to combine your knowledge and consider the following factors to generate a piece of false information based on the text (and picture) and the requirement given to you by the user.
Factors to consider include information authenticity, semantic consistency, language fluency, emotion and provocation, target audience, cultural and social background, and diffusion potential
Information authenticity: The generated false information should contain some real details to enhance its credibility.
Semantic consistency: The generated false information should be semantically related to the input text and maintain consistency.
Language fluency: The generated false information should have good grammatical structure and language fluency.
Emotion and provocation: The generated false information can be emotional and may be provocative to trigger an emotional response from the reader.
Target audience: Understand the background, interests and preferences of the target audience to generate more influential false information.
Cultural and social background: The content of false information should consider the cultural and social background so that it is more acceptable to the target audience.
Diffusion potential: The text or picture needs to have a high dissemination potential and be easy to share on social media or other channels.

Given the following text: 
{text}
Based on the above text, the following content is user's requirement.
{requirement}
Output(YOU ONLY NEED TO OUTPUT THE DESCRIPTION!):

PROMPT_rate = '''
You are an information generation expert. 
Please evaluate and score from the following perspectives, assigning a score from 1 to 5 according to the degree from low to high. 
(1) Alignment: The text and the description may show varying degrees of alignment, meaning they have a certain degree of consistency. The higher the consistency, the higher the score. 
(2) Causality confusion: The description may confuse correlations presented in the text as causal relationships. The lower the degree of causality confusion, the higher the score. 
(3) Accuracy: This refers to whether the description is qualitatively and quantitatively in accordance with scientific accuracy. The higher the accuracy, the higher the score. 
(4) Generalization: This refers to whether the description excessively generalizes or oversimplifies the text. The lower the degree of generalization, the higher the score. 
(5) Contextual fidelity: Does the description retain the broader context of the text? The higher the fidelity, the higher the score. 
(6) Strong Global Coherence (SGC): Each sentence in the description must contain content mentioned in the text. The higher the SGC, the higher the score. 
(7) Weak Global Coherence (WGC): All sentences in the description should contain or maintain a neutral relationship with the text. Therefore, no sentence in the description should contradict the content of the text. The higher the WGC, the higher the score. 
(8) Local Coherence (LC): In the description, two sentences should not contradict each other. The higher the LC, the higher the score. 

Given the following text: 
{text}
Based on the above text, here is the following description:
